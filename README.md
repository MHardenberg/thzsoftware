#thzsoftware
This is the codebase for THz Photonics group at Aarhus University. It includes python code for data analysis of THz time domain spectroscopy (TDS) and
later other methods. The intention is to develop a specialized tool box, or library, in python for the data analysis we commonly employ. E.g. tds in transmission and reflection, and later even the machine learning scripts for classifying plastics. This should save time and ensure a higher standard of quality, as it is tested and maintained by the members of the group. Opposed to everyone just writing their own quick scripts over and over again.

All code contained in the project should by:
	- tested: All code should be written in a test-driven proces. 
	- efficient / optimized: If one member finds another, better function, that function should replace the old one. (tests should not be changed here, as they ensure that new functions are compatible.
	- well documented: A documentation for all functions and sub-tool boxes will be provided and should be updated as needed.





To Do:

	* Finnish tds tool boxes.
	* Write documentation:
		* For all functions
		* How to alter functions
		* How to add functions / tool boxes



Tutorials:

	* virtual environments and how to use 'venv': https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv
		The current version employs venv and only has to be actived when modifing the code.
